First I downloaded the csvkit, which allows me me to convert and work with csv files.

I went into my assignments directory

I created a file name filter.py and added a program that reads data in a csv file into the file.

I then made the script executable using the chmod command

I then downloaded data directly from a website using the curl command.

I redirected the output into a file I created called expensive_water.csv

I piped expensive_water.csv into csvstat and then I redirected (added it) into a new file called expensive_water_summary.txt 

Then, open the file in excel
